This section is meant to detail the features in this thesis template and necessary steps you should take. The thesis is inspired by #link("https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ucl-phd-thesis-template/tcdxmjdxbfhh.pdf")["Pawel's LaTeX template"]. Like their template, this PhD thesis is geared towards PhDs in STEM fields.

+ This section is inside `main.typ` as `#include "demo.typ"`. This line should be deleted before submission. You can optionally delete this file afterwards or turn it into something useful.
+ After reading this document, please take some time to read through the comments littered around in `main.typ`, the project root file, and `ucl-thesis.typ` which contains the style code that makes up this thesis template. There are also a few convenience commands to mimic their LaTeX equivalent.
+ Please ensure to insert an image of your signature in the right section.
+ If you are editing locally, I recommend Visual Studio Code with the #link("https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist")[Tinymist] extension (or any editor with support for it) as well as #link("https://github.com/typstyle-rs/typstyle")[typstyle] linter to format your Typst code. Even if you have a potato device, Typst compiles _really_ quickly even for hundred+ page documents with many packages, which your thesis likely will be.
+ In this thesis, Typst's native `bibliography` is used, with an example bib file in `main.bib` - see also `main.typ` for how it's imported. The bib format is *biblatex*. An example citation is @alvarezQuantumMechanicsClassical1989
  - Instead of using default `american-physics-society` citation style, I have hacked it (thanks to the Typst wizards of the internet!) so that DOI/links are clickable (as per UCL guidelines) and coloured for visibility. Some things may be broken - please let me know or submit an issue #link("https://github.com/chpxu/ucl-phd-thesis-template")[on the repository].
  - Typst by default doesn't have support for bibliographies across multiple files. If you need multiple bibliographies in general, the #link("https://typst.app/universe/package/alexandria")[alexandria] package may be useful and you can import it in `ucl-thesis.typ`. However, I have used another hack to get the same bibliography: simply call `#load-bib()` at the end of each subfile. If you change from the default `main.bib`, call it as `#load-bib(bib-file: "file.bib")`.
+ To include more `.typ` files, see files in various directories and also `main.typ` on how to use them.
+ The total wordcount is automatically handled by the #link("https://typst.app/universe/package/wordometer/")[wordometer] package. As per the RDF: "The maximum word lengths include footnotes, tables and figures but exclude bibliography, appendices and supporting data" and the template has excluded the appendices and bibliography.

== Features
This sub-section aims to demonstrate the default packages I have included.


Your thesis is a living document. It will contain your research over the years. It's easy to make a note on your phone, a different software, pen and paper etc but it's also hard to find that same information much later down the line, so why not note in the document!
#margin-note(side: left)[Cite this sentence]
This is achieved by the #link("https://typst.app/universe/package/drafting")[drafting] package.

As a thesis targeted towards STEM, there are a lot of STEM-related packages. As a computational physicist myself, I write a lot of math - the #link("https://typst.app/universe/package/physica")[physica] package makes writing derivatives and other stuff a lot more convenient:

$
  hat(H) = & -frac(hbar^2, 2m_e)sum_i grad^2_i - sum_(i,I) frac(Z_I e^2, abs(bold(r)_i - bold(R)_I)) + frac(1, 2) sum_(i != j) frac(e^2, abs(bold(r)_i - bold(r)_j)) \ & - sum_i frac(hbar^2, 2M_I)grad^2_I + frac(1, 2) sum_(I != J) frac(Z_I Z_J e^2, abs(bold(R)_I - bold(R)_J))
$ <eqn:fullschrodinger>
which is written:
#codly(languages: codly-languages)
```typst
$
  hat(H) = & -frac(hbar^2, 2m_e)sum_i grad^2_i - sum_(i,I) frac(Z_I e^2, abs(bold(r)_i - bold(R)_I)) + frac(1, 2) sum_(i != j) frac(e^2, abs(bold(r)_i - bold(r)_j)) \ & - sum_i frac(hbar^2, 2M_I)grad^2_I + frac(1, 2) sum_(I != J) frac(Z_I Z_J e^2, abs(bold(R)_I - bold(R)_J))
$ <eqn:fullschrodinger>

```
The `grad` command is part of `physica`, and this code block was beautifully displayed by #link("https://typst.app/universe/package/codly")[codly]!


#link("https://typst.app/universe/package/quill")[quill] provides the ability to draw quantum circuits!

If you scroll up to the list of figures, you'll see this has automatically been included! Any figure considered an image (e.g. most things. Tables go in a separate section) will be automatically added! The same for tables, and the same for algorithms

Finally, here's the UCL logo as an example figure
